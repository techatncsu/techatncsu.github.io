                                <p>Feed the Pack is a community-based initiative sustained by the greater NC State community to combat the food insecurity experienced by members of the Wolfpack family.</p>
                                <a href="https://feedthepack.dasa.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank"><b>View Feed The Pack</b></a>
								<!-- <p>This project was done in collaboration with Feed The Pack, a leading food pantry in our community. Previously, most of Feed the Pack's data and processes were done manually by their staff and volunteers and we at Tech@NC State wanted to help them out by integrating their processes with new technologies and automation.</p> -->

                                <h2>Our Project</h2>
                                <p>We are building software for Feed The Pack that automates most of their administrative work, keep log of the volunteer schedule and provide analytics about the data collected from them.</p>
								<!--<p>We created a software that helped the Feed The Pack team save up their time on the administrative work and we provided them with analytics from all the data that was generated. There's a screenshot of the software above, which show the *feature* of the software.</p> -->

                        <p>Our mission is to equip Computer Science & Electrical Engineering students at NC State with the knowledge and connections they need to get the best technical job. We aim to create a collaboration where students can share and learn from the technical and interview experiences of their peers, so as to assist others in achieving similar career goals. Towards this we provide workshops, tech talks, and recruitment connections.</p>
